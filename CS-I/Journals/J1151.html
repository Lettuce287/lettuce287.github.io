	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3 class="question">1.1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?</h3>
	It allows for specific behaviors to happen if a certain condition is met.
	<h3 class="question">1.2: Why do you think the term <i>consequent</i> is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the <i>Boolean test</i> evaluates to true?</h3>
	Because the result is the <i>consequence</i> of the test evaluating as true.

	<h2>Section 2</h2>
	<h3 class="question">2.1: Why is the first <i>Jump</i> instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not?</h3>
	It jumps if and only if the value is less than 4.
	<h3 class="question">2.2: What is the purpose of the <i>Jump</i> instruction after the <i>consequent</i>?</h3>
	It skips the alternative section and goes to the end of the sequence.
	<h3 class="question">2.3: Why is there no need for a corresponding <i>Jump</i> instruction after the <i>alternative</i>?</h3>
	It's the end of the code, meaning that the program has exited and cannot perform any more conditionals

	<h2>What did I learn? What is the big idea?</h2>
	I learned about conditionals and how they are applied within different code environments.
	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	I encountered challenges in figuring out my answers to the ponder questions.
	<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	It would be nice if the instructions to upload the xml file to tabby were included on the lesson page.
	<h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
	I now know how to use conditionals in assembly code and proper organization of asm code.
