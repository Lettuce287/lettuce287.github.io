	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3 class="question">1.1 Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h3>
	Align all the digits vertically, then add the rightmost column. If the sum is greater than the quantity that can be represented by a single digit, carry 1 over. Repeat until the last digit is reached.
	
	<h2>Section 2</h2>
	<h3 class="question">2.2 What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
	The sum cannot be 8 or greater. If it is, it's subtracted by 8 and 1 is carried over to the next digit.
	
	<h2>Section 3</h2>
	<h3 class="question">What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
	Just like octal, the sum can't be 16 or greater, or else it's subtracted by 16 with 1 carrying over. Numbers past 9 also have to be represented with letters ranging from A-F.
	
	<h2>Section 3</h2>
	<h3 class="question">What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
	When adding, if the sum is 2 or greater, the number is replaced with a 0 and 1 is carried over to the next place.
	
	<h2>What did I learn? What is the big idea?</h2>
	I learned how alternative base addition works and the various rules and differences to adding different bases
	
	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	I was slightly confused with binary since it didn't really follow the same sort of rules that hex and octal did, where instead you needed to replace the number with a 0 before carrying a 1 over.
	
	<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	This experience could be improved by being a bit more "descriptive" in showing the process of addition, where the steps are represented by more easy to take in images instead of a table with a really long description next to it.

	<h2>Free reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
	I didn't really know there were different ways to do addition, I was so used to just normal addition with the decimal system which made this lesson feel really strange to me.
