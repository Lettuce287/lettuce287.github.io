	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3 class="question">1.1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the <b>C</b>arry column?</h3>
	The truth table for equivalence.
	<h3 class="question">1.2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the <b>S</b>um column?</h3>
	The truth table for exclusive OR.

	<h2>Section 2</h2>
	<h3 class="question">2.1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h3>
	They're both the same.
	<h3 class="question">2.2: Why is that true?</h3>
	All the rows except for Cin are the exact same.

	<h2>Section 3</h2>
	<h3 class="question">3.1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h3>
	They cannot use a full-adder as there is no Cin input.
	<h3 class="question">3.2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h3>
	No, since the C value still needs to cascade down in order to produce the S values.
	<h3 class="question">3.3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h3>
	It can be inferred that the 15th adder had 2 large A/B inputs, and thus had a large carry.
	
	
	<h2>What did I learn? What is the big idea?</h2>
	I learned how binary adders work and what the idea of ripple carrying is.
	
	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	I encountered challenges in trying to answer section 3, question 3.
	
	<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	I don't think it needs much improvement, but I wish the ripple carry part was expanded on a bit more.
	
	<h2>Free reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
	My thinking was affected because now I know how much work it takes to add binary numbers.
