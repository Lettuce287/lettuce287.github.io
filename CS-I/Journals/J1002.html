	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3 class="question">1.1 Name at least two other services that you personally use that are implemented using the Client/Server Model.</h3>
	Two other services I use that are implemented using a Client/Server Model are Discord and Peardeck.
	
	<h2>Section 2</h2>
	<h3 class="question">2.1 It appears that both Jack and John Wiliams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
	The ability for two users to have different directories with the same name is beneficial because it allows for users to have more clear and concise names for their directories instead of having to work around having conflicting names.
	
	<h3 class="question">2.2 If this wasn't possible, what would you need to do instead?</h3>
	If this wasn't possible, directories would have to be named "creatively", like "Digital Portfolio_27". This would also break the Merlin directory, which is needed for missions.
	
	<h2>Section 3</h2>
	<h3 class="question">3.1 Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it? </h3>
      To easily identify it.
	
	<h2>Section 4</h2>
	<h3 class="question">4.1 Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
	It changed to ~/Merlin$. This is useful because it tells you exactly what directory you're in and the file path to it.
	
	<h2>Section 5</h2>
	<h3 class="question">5.1 What happens each time you press the up arrow?</h3>
	It brings back a previously run command.
	<h3 class="question">5.2 What happens each time you press the down arrow?</h3>
	It undoes what the up arrow does.
	
	<h2>Section 6</h2>
	<h3 class="question">6.1 Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
	It was not printed to the screen. Instead, it was put into a new file called out.txt.
	
	<h2>Section 7</h2>
	<h3 class="question">7.1 How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
	It shows all files only in the current directory.
	<h3 class="question">7.2 How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
	If you need to see what files are in previous directories, you can use tree instead of ls.

	<h2>Section 8</h2>
	<h3 class="question">8.1 What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
	It specifies for the terminal to "sleep" or wait for a set number of seconds.
	<h3 class="question">8.2 Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
	Yes, I can run the command and then see if I am able to use any other commands while the terminal sleeps.
	
	<h2>Section 9</h2>
	<h3 class="question">9.1 How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
	It doesn't impede running commands normally.
	<h3 class="question">9.2 What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
	For it to be ran without interrupting other foreground jobs.
	<h3 class="question">9.3 What do you think the number displayed in the brackets specifies?</h3>
	I think it means what position in the queue the job is in.
	
	<h2>Section 10</h2>
	<h3 class="question">10.1 What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h3>
	I can see a list of the current jobs being run.
	<h3 class="question">10.2 How do you explain your observations?</h3>
	It's showing that I have emacs running right now and that it's stopped.
	
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the big idea?</h2>
      I learned how to use the shell.
      
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      I did not encounter any challenges.
      
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      This experience doesn't need to be improved.
      
      <h2>Free reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      I now realize that I can use the shell.
