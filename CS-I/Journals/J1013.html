	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3 class="question">1.1 Why is one of the symbols for exclusive disjunction (pretend theres a symbol here)</h3>
	Because it's resemblant to equivalence where both values need to be something but has a slash between them because it has to not be true.
	
	<h2>Section 2</h2>
	<h3 class="question">2.1 Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n?</h3>
	n represents the number of inputs, which becomes the exponent of 2 to represent the number of possible combinations.
	
	<h2>What did I learn? What is the big idea?</h2>
	I learned about what boolean algebra is and how it's used in computer logic.
	
	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	I encountered challenges when trying to memorize the formulas, since there's a lot to take in.
	
	<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	This experience could be improved by going a bit more in-depth with the different ideas, currently it's too straightforward in trying to cover everything that it becomes confusing.
	
	<h2>Free reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
	I now realize that I will need to do a lot of studying to fully understand this unit, eventually I'll get it though!
