	<p>Hi! My name is Nathan, and I'm in 10th grade. Currently, I'm taking CS I and plan to take CS all the way through senior year if I can. I play cello and like to learn code in my free time. I'm also enrolled in the associates degree program, where I take dual credit early in order to earn my associates of arts in Business when I graduate alongside my diploma. I can't wait to learn more in this class!</p>
