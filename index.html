	<h2>The Importance of a Digital Portfolio</h2>
	<p>A digital portfolio is important because it allows me to document the things I've learned. This is helpful because it not only shows me how much my knowledge has grown since the beginning of class, but also allows me to have something to check back on in case I'm confused with anything later.</p>
